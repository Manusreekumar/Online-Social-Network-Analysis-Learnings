1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 238 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?


Friend_overlap function essentially tells you the number of common followers for two people. In this particular instance , Jill stein and Gary Johnson have 238 common followers while Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have only 1 common follower. But this statistic does not essentially mean that people with more common followers are similar , since Jill Stein and Gary Johnson have entirely different career paths and political alignments. The only obvious commonality between them is that both were presidential candidates for 2016 election.

In my opinion, to understand the similarity between two people, the statistic regarding the number of common pages that they follow might be providing a better information. For Example, if two people are from the field of theortical physics like Michio Kaku and Neil Degrasse Tyson, their similarity would be reflected in the kind of pages and people they might be following. 




2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.













3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?









4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?
